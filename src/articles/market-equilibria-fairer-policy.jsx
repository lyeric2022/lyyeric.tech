      The convergence of <InteractiveFormula 
        formula="Equilibrium = where opposing forces balance"
        explanation="In economics, equilibrium occurs when supply equals demand, or when no party has incentive to change the current state. In policy, it's where the forces pushing for change balance with forces maintaining the status quo."
        triggerText="market equilibria"
      /> toward fairer policy (from my lens).
    </p>
    <br />

    <p>
      I define "fair" as the near-perfect balance in X (rights, rewards, treatment, punishment, etc.) as a result of one's actions and existence. Perfect fairness is obviously impossible.
    </p>
    <br />

    <p>
      The thesis: as time passes, better-aligned incentives enable affected parties to make or adjust the current equilibrium, and the <InteractiveFormula 
        formula="σ = √(Σ(xᵢ - μ)² / n)"
        explanation="Standard deviation measures how spread out values are from the mean. Here, it represents the variation in negative perception of a policy—lower standard deviation means more consistent (and likely fairer) policy outcomes across different groups."
        triggerText="standard deviation"
      /> (in negative perception) of X policy drops.
    </p>
    <br />

    <p>
      How this works: more-affected parties have stronger incentives to shift the curve than less-affected parties. If X policy generally benefits group A more than group B, then group B's incentive to change exceeds group A's incentive to maintain. Over time, X policy converges toward a fairer equilibrium.
    </p>

      This is quite simplistic, and it isn't to say that things will only ever get better (which is obviously stupid). But the underlying market principles remain.
    </p>
    <br />

      I'm part of that niche minority of historians who believe that economics ended slavery, rather than the White majority simply having a change of heart. As cotton prices decreased from competition, it became less economically viable to own slaves. At the same time, as African Americans became further integrated into Northern societies, their economic contributions grew rapidly, and it made the White American majority far less incentivized to keep African Americans enslaved. Without such market pressures, slavery would have likely continued much longer. 
    </p>
    <br />

    <p>
      This isn't at all to discredit the work of the many activists involved or to claim that the market would have simply resolved itself without those individuals. But had Martin Luther King Jr. never been born, a similar African American leader would likely have emerged in his place. On the other hand, without market forces shifting the practical incentives of the White majority, it would have made little sense for them to vote against their own incentives and free enslaved African Americans. Without such forces, abolitionists would have found it much harder to justify their cause on moral grounds alone.
    </p>
    <br />

    <p>
      On women's rights, the same logic applies. Men had little incentive to continue the disenfranchisement of women. As women climbed the educational ladder and entered the workforce, the passage of time essentially guaranteed eventual equal rights.
    </p>
    <br />

      Fundamentally, current policies are the result of many parties pushing the equilibrium acceptance of X policy over time. Despite imperfections, the standard deviation of negative sentiment has continuously depreciated.
    </p>
    <br />

    <p>
      The policies that seem imperfect today are the result of many forces, but they are not random. Given sufficient time, market pressures inevitably force such policies to converge closer to social equilibrium. This requires stakeholders having generally pro-American values + informational freedom, institutions being trusted + balanced + capable, and policymakers having aligned incentives with their voters.
    </p>
    <br />

    <p>
      Given a future where the United States does not collapse from external forces, (most) social policy will likely converge toward a fairer equilibrium. We'll face convergence turbulence and time-drag (lobbyists having outsized influence) but eventually, the general distance from the true balance is reduced.
    </p>
    <br />

    <p>
      It's difficult to foresee what true equilibrium looks like. But eventually, I hope that with the proper tools and technologies, we can graphically locate the misallocations in balance and develop a system that is fairer for us all.
    </p>
    <br />

    <p>
      By developing this draft, I hope my audience finds the thesis insightful. From my perspective, much of today's society could be better addressed by understanding policycraft through the lens of market equilibrium.
    </p>
    <br />

    <p>
      Also, thank you China. Thank you for pressuring America to better allocate its talent and resources as a means of competing against you. Technology would have progressed much more slowly otherwise, and there would have been less incentive for investment. China forces the USA to be better, and vice versa.

    <h2>More: how to go about changing social policy (in my opinion)</h2>

    <p>
      First, understand the underlying principles in order to better approach and solve problems.
    </p>

      For some groups, like anti-meat activists, the struggle is insanely high. Meat eaters are far more numerous, with immense incentives to maintain the status quo. If you genuinely want to shift the accepted equilibrium, typical advocacy practices won't work. The issue isn't a misalignment of information. You must change the equilibrium itself by altering incentives. In a world where plant-based protein tastes better, is more nutritious, and costs less, meat eaters' incentive to continue effectively collapses.
    </p>
    <br />

    <p>
      For other issues, like NIMBYism, changing the equilibrium is also quite difficult. It's a classic <InteractiveFormula 
        formula="Collective Action Problem: Individual incentive ≠ Group benefit"
        explanation="A collective action problem occurs when what's best for the group (society benefits from development) conflicts with what's best for each individual (homeowner benefits from blocking development locally). Each person has incentive to free-ride or act against the group interest."
        triggerText="collective action problem"
      />: society benefits from development, but each individual homeowner benefits more from blocking it locally. Sillier options include government-mandated construction, higher taxes, and weaker homeowner rights. Yet these are likely to be met with strong retaliation that pushes equilibrium back to the status quo. However, one interesting solution is enabling zoning freedom. By allowing homeowners new opportunities to capitalize on the market distortion (selling to developers, building more units, etc.), density can be achieved without interference from opposing parties.
    </p>
    <br />

    <p>
      In essence, by first understanding the incentives of opposing forces and then better aligning those incentives, fairer equilibria can be reached.
