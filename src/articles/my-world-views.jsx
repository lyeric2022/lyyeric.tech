      I was born to a Chinese-Viet dad and a Viet mom. My paternal grandfather served in the South Vietnamese army, and that side came to America as post-war political refugees after his release. My mom later came alone through sponsorship after meeting my dad. They worked very long hours in hard labor, and raised me up in Garden Grove, CA– a suburban area that hosts a very large Vietnamese diaspora. I love my Vietnamese heritage a lot, and I am so blessed to experience so much diverse cultural wealth that inhibits my geographic region.

      On religion, I used to be an atheist all my life. As a child, my parents placed me into many camps for both Buddhism and Catholicism. I had a great time, and I value the communities that welcomed me. Yet no convincing of God made much sense to me, and I've given up trying many years ago. However, I do have a great opinion of believers; community involvement is quite favorable towards a good life, and the teachings mirror logical early-century nation-building that would've still spawned absent religion. Months ago though, I've come to realize that human society may never actually come to disproving God's existence. Thus, if atheism similarly requires faith in unprovable assumptions, belief should lie more so towards adjacency to values.

      The meaning of life to me, is to build heaven on earth and to procreate. I hold the former view because as I don't follow any common religions, it is necessary that I create my own, less I fall towards nihilism. "Heaven on earth" defined by me, is the idea that we as humans should strive to continuously improve our setting for ourselves and kin, and make it so that our setting is so near-utopian that it is indistinguishable from otherwise perfect settings as described in popular religions. "Procreation" stems from my belief that the American nation is stronger with more of us, and such means are also necessary to ensure species continuity and evolution.

      On world views, I am quite nationalistic, wherein I vigorously love my country, and want it to succeed above all others. This does not mean that my government represents my views, nor that my country is superior to any other. International law is very important in the greater prosperity of human society, but agreements should never place America disadvantageously.

      On social views, I believe diversity is a core American strength. America benefits insanely with the pools of talent that it's able to draw from, and even absent support, it is able to produce global champions across all arenas. Albeit not all cultures are compatible with America's. As much as America is a melting pot of many groups and cultures, and generally benefits from the competitive mixing, it also stands that only people whose beliefs would benefit our communities, should be allowed in. This doesn't mean their cultures are any worse than ours, but that it seems rather self-destructive to enable such individuals residence, in the name of empathy.

      On economics, I support abundance economics, which focuses on subsidizing, investing into the supply productions of goods, in order to make them more abundant for societal access and enable industries to be more globally competitive. It is less efficient, yet I believe the marginal social and national advantages make the inefficiency worth the sacrifice. Every citizen should be able to comfortably access groceries, housing, healthcare, education, infrastructure, energy.

      I think it's general unsuccess stems from how current economic planners are not very capable, and such massive inefficiencies detract much of the promised social, national gains. My country does not lack talent and I have hope that my country will elect truly more competent economic leaders. It is sad that libertarians are able to evidence better outcomes from laissez-faire, as current systems incentivize policy makers to prioritize self-preservation over national duty.

      But corrected, Keynesian becomes a multiplier. Countries such as China, Korea, Singapore, etc., are able to capture enormous upside with their industrial policies, and create massive growth for their country. We should do the same; we're already the greatest nation in reallocating private capital towards investments in R&D, and this has led to enormous gains for tech companies. And we've also done it already in the past with public capital as well: the railroads, the highways, the atomic bomb. Even currently, the US is demonstrating incredible capabilities to somewhat support enterprises involved in tech and defense to compete against China. We should reproduce these abilities and competencies across all sectors.

      On social issues, staunch pragmatism precedes everything else, and so I support positions that maximize in pareto efficiencies between my interests and my nation. I also hold strong conviction regarding that market equilibria also extends towards societal variance in views, and so that it is wasteful for most individuals to care in shifting such equilibriums. I do hate inefficiencies though, and I think proper mechanism design systems (wherein selfish actions of participants lead to desirable societal outcomes), should be a requirement across all policies. I hate that many current/proposed policies tend to forget about potential second-order effects.

      On intelligence, I think that some of the greatest showcases are the ability to predict the future (pattern recognition), and the ability to attain one's goals. Wealth creation is a general goal that lifts all boats, and this meant that growing up, I dedicated a lot of time towards exploring what I could do to maximize impact. I explored a lot in many diverse areas, especially history, to better predict future scenarios. Like any other person, I don't have certainty over many predictions, but the best way to improve my views is to validate uncertainties earlier by trying it out.

      On career, I have a strong desire to build a lot of wealth before age degrades my abilities, and I think the best way is to have ownership over endeavors that will benefit humanity. The larger, more complex problems tend to reward generously, and so I want to be early and involved in fields that have potential to solve such problems. As such, tech made the most sense. The tail rewards within tech are magnitudes larger than any other, and compared to healthcare and law, individual contributions are less tied to capital and time. I also love techy nerd culture and entrepreneurship, and both concepts' buildership mentalities tie quite nicely with my own.

      Lastly, at a dinner not too long ago, I heard about a great perspective from an angel investor. He is quite successful in the eyes of many, loves his wife and children, and he treats life as a simulation, wherein he is the player tasked to navigate in-game uncertainties to attain his goals. I find this to be a gravely useful model for myself, and I greatly admire people whose convictions are so high. I find that success often follows those with strong, defensible convictions.
