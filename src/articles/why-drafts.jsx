      I'm quite a bad writer, but my algo has been curating me very good content and articles lately, and so I want to explore writing again.

      I write a lot on my private account to my friends. Not sure if I love writing, but I love expressing my thoughts and revisiting them months later. They're not always the most readable if I'm honest, but they capture specific, precise emotions of the time.

      With the release of Seedance 2, I find that many of these videos aren't just eerie anymore, but actually really good. Within half a year, I think a couple videos will start hitting 10 million+ views and bring upon quite fun experiences that can succeed even beyond doom scrolls.

      Yet I find it peculiar that AI writing is interesting because it is so… easy to tell. Even if you were to prompt it to "sound human" and "remove em dashes" and "change up sentence structures" and "be unique, avoid conjunctions and quirks and avoid common comparisons", none of these improve the writing anywhere enough to mimic anything of high quality. How is it that generative videos can mimic our reality so well, yet generative writing is so… strangely average.

      I don't know what great writing is, but I'd call a writing just that when it feels like the reader is directly speaking to me, and I can imagine the author's heartbeats from their typing keys.

      Anyways, I think about a lot of niches, and I'm in need of a space to share them. Thanks for enduring :)

      A couple writers' pieces that I found really great (and take inspo from):

      I do have imposter syndrome, but I also don't really care enough to make it good, because good writing takes time, and I'd rather do anything else than spend so much time in refinement hell. Though I do secretly crave a future where I am so beyond peculiar, and my draft imperfects are looked back on in wonder and imitation.
